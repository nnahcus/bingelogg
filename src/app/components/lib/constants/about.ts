    "Bingelogg is a simple, minimal space for tracking movie you’ve watched. Actually, not only you can track movies, but you can track medias like books, games, manga and anime all in one place. \n\nYou can write what you’re watching, rate films, create wishlists, view your journey timeline, and see your personal movie habits through minimal graphs and stats. \n\nEverything is kept calm, organized just like a paper planner."
